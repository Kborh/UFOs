#  Analysis on UFO


## Project Overview
      This objective of the project was demonstrate the use of Javascript to create an interactive website, 
      specifically using D3.js to collect HTML form elements in the form of DOMs (Document Object Models) and
      adding event triggers to elements on the page and filter the given dataset based on user entry. 
      
      
## Technologies/Resources use:
    . JavaScript
    . HTML
    . CSS
    . D3
    
## Result:
    This new app allows for users to enter multiple search criteia, such as Date, City, Country, and Shape.
    Users can enter one or any number of parameters and the app.js file manipulate and create a table based on 
    the filters, and the filtered table will displayed on the page. Futher more, when you click on the filetr, 
    a dropdown manu with possible values can be seen. As you choose a value, a new table would appear below the line of filters.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
## Summery:
   1. As a recommendation, there should be a reload button created to reset the table to its unfiltered state.
   2. A downloadable button, which will allow users to download the table in either JSON or CSV format, should be put in place.
      
      This project is a simple example of using D3 to manipulate the DOM and create a table from a small amount of data stored in a JavaScript file. The user can filter the data by any number of parameters and the app.js file will manipulate the DOM and create a table based on the filters.
